# How to Run Mac Whisperer with Debugging

## ✅ Test Results So Far:
1. **Clipboard test**: ✅ PASSED - pbcopy/pbpaste work correctly
2. **Transcription flow test**: ✅ PASSED - Text copies to clipboard and verifies
3. **Dependencies**: ✅ All installed

## 🚀 To Run the App:

```bash
cd /Users/dilip/Documents/Personal/Wispher/mac-whisperer
venv/bin/python whisper-dictation.py -m base.en
```

## 📝 What to Look For:

When you dictate something, watch the Terminal output for these debug messages:

### ✅ Success Messages:
```
[DEBUG] Clipboard verified: 'your transcribed text...'
✓ Text typed and saved to clipboard
```

### ⚠️ Warning Messages:
```
[WARNING] Clipboard mismatch!
[CRITICAL ERROR] Failed to copy to clipboard!
✗ Typing failed: <error>
✓ Text is in clipboard - paste with Cmd+V (⌘V) on Mac
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT - Mac Keyboard Shortcuts:

**On macOS, paste is:**
- ✅ **Cmd+V** (⌘V) - Command key + V
- ❌ **NOT Ctrl+V** - This won't work on Mac!

The Command key is the one with the ⌘ symbol, usually next to the spacebar.

## 🔧 Debugging Steps:

1. **Run the app** from Terminal (so you see debug output)
2. **Hold Cmd+Option** to start recording
3. **Speak something** (e.g., "this is a test")
4. **Release Cmd+Option** to stop
5. **Watch Terminal** for debug messages
6. **Try pasting** with **Cmd+V** (not Ctrl+V!)

## 📋 Expected Flow:

```
User: [Holds Cmd+Option and speaks]
Terminal: "Listening..."
User: [Releases keys]
Terminal: "Transcribing..."
Terminal: "[DEBUG] Clipboard verified: 'your text...'"
Terminal: "✓ Text typed and saved to clipboard"
Terminal: "Done."
User: [Presses Cmd+V in any text field]
Result: Text appears!
```

## 🐛 If It Still Doesn't Work:

Please share:
1. The Terminal output (especially [DEBUG] and [WARNING] messages)
2. Which key combo you're using to paste (Cmd+V or Ctrl+V?)
3. What happens when you try to paste
